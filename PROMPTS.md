# ChatGPT (4) Prompt

I want to build a PWA for a site that has google maps at the top then a list of events where each has title, name and location.
The stack i want to use is Typescript, Nuxt 3 latest, Pinia, Firebase for authentication, Firestore for storing events and reviews on the events, Tailwindcss as part of @nuxt/ui, kevinmarrec/nuxt-pwa, iconify/json, nuxtjs/i18n with prefix_except_default strategy to support english and arabic, arabic is default, nuxt-gtag for google analytics, the app should be a single page app hosted on a static site hosting (github).

I want to activate store through pinia, pages directory, layout directory, and remove App.vue

The app is going to be called "الشرقية تبدع" for meta tags and PWA

I would like to separate configs into app.config.ts, i18n.config.ts, nuxt.config.ts
I want also to use pnpm as a package manager, and changeset to track changes
the website is going to be hosted on <https://ithra.6degrees.com.sa/> during development
would you walk me through it  ?
